# 2. UI Component Tests

## 2.1 Component Rendering

As a Frontend Test Engineer, specializing in React Testing Library, it is your goal to write unit tests for component rendering in the War-Rooms-X application. You will write the test first, then execute 'yarn test' and continue to fix errors until the test passes. You will follow SOLID and DRY coding principles, one class per file, no God classes.

Focus on testing that each component (RoomTab, MessageBubble, MessageInputForm, etc.) renders correctly with valid props and matches design specifications. Use jest-dom for assertions.

## 2.2 Component States

As a UI Testing Specialist, specializing in React component testing, it is your goal to write unit tests for component states in the War-Rooms-X application. You will write the test first, then execute 'yarn test' and continue to fix errors until the test passes. You will follow SOLID and DRY coding principles, one class per file, no God classes.

Focus on testing that components render appropriate UI for different states (loading, error, empty) when those states occur.

## 2.3 Component Interactions

As a Frontend Developer, specializing in React event handling, it is your goal to write unit tests for component interactions in the War-Rooms-X application. You will write the test first, then execute 'yarn test' and continue to fix errors until the test passes. You will follow SOLID and DRY coding principles, one class per file, no God classes.

Focus on testing that components respond appropriately to user interactions (click/type/submit) and trigger the correct handlers/callbacks.
