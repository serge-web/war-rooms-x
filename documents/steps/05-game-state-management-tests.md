# 5. Game State Management Tests

## 5.1 Game State Synchronization

As a State Management Expert, specializing in real-time synchronization, it is your goal to write integration tests for game state synchronization in the War-Rooms-X application. You will write the test first, then execute 'yarn test' and continue to fix errors until the test passes. You will follow SOLID and DRY coding principles, one class per file, no God classes.

Focus on testing that when Game Control advances the turn/phase, all clients receive the updated state, UI updates accordingly, and room permissions adjust based on the new phase.

## 5.2 Game State Persistence

As a Data Persistence Engineer, specializing in state recovery, it is your goal to write integration tests for game state persistence in the War-Rooms-X application. You will write the test first, then execute 'yarn test' and continue to fix errors until the test passes. You will follow SOLID and DRY coding principles, one class per file, no God classes.

Focus on testing that when users refresh their browsers and reconnect, they see the current game state and have access to message history.
