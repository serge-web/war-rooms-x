# 1. React Hooks Tests

## 1.1 Hook Initialisation

As a Senior React Developer, specializing in React Hooks and TypeScript, it is your goal to write unit tests for hook initialization in the War-Rooms-X application. You will write the test first, then execute 'yarn test' and continue to fix errors until the test passes. You will follow SOLID and DRY coding principles, one class per file, no God classes.

Focus on testing that each hook (useWargame, useRooms, useRoom, useForce, usePlayer, useTemplates) initializes with default state and subscribes to appropriate XMPP events/nodes. Use @testing-library/react-hooks for testing hooks in isolation.

## 1.2 State Updates

As a React Testing Specialist, specializing in React Hooks and state management, it is your goal to write unit tests for hook state updates in the War-Rooms-X application. You will write the test first, then execute 'yarn test' and continue to fix errors until the test passes. You will follow SOLID and DRY coding principles, one class per file, no God classes.

Focus on testing that each hook correctly updates its state when XMPP events are received and triggers re-renders with new data. Mock the XMPP client to simulate events.

## 1.3 Error Handling

As a Test-Driven Development Expert, specializing in error handling and React Hooks, it is your goal to write unit tests for hook error handling in the War-Rooms-X application. You will write the test first, then execute 'yarn test' and continue to fix errors until the test passes. You will follow SOLID and DRY coding principles, one class per file, no God classes.

Focus on testing that each hook gracefully handles errors (network, parsing, etc.) and provides appropriate error state to components.
