# War-Rooms-X: Test Strategy Document

## üìã Overview

This document outlines the high-level testing strategy for the War-Rooms-X distributed wargaming application. The strategy focuses on behavior-driven testing using ReactJS, TypeScript, Jest, and Playwright to achieve comprehensive code coverage across all application features.

## üéØ Testing Goals

1. Verify all functional requirements are correctly implemented
2. Ensure proper handling of real-time communication via XMPP
3. Validate role-based access controls and permissions
4. Test structured messaging and template functionality
5. Verify game state management and synchronization
6. Ensure responsive UI and proper component rendering
7. Validate admin functionality for game setup and management

## üß™ Testing Approach

### Test Pyramid Structure

```
                    /\
                   /  \
                  /E2E \
                 /------\
                /  Int.  \
               /----------\
              /    Unit    \
             /--------------\
```

- **Unit Tests (Jest)**: 60% of test effort
- **Integration Tests (Jest)**: 25% of test effort
- **E2E Tests (Playwright)**: 15% of test effort

### Testing Methodology

```
For each feature:
  1. Identify key behaviors
  2. Define happy paths
  3. Define error paths
  4. Write unit tests for hooks and components
  5. Write integration tests for feature interactions
  6. Write E2E tests for critical user flows
```

## üìä Test Coverage Areas

### 1. Authentication & Authorization

```pseudocode
FEATURE: User Authentication
  SCENARIO: Valid login
    GIVEN a user with valid credentials
    WHEN they submit the login form
    THEN they should be authenticated
    AND redirected to the appropriate view based on their role
    AND their presence should be logged in __system_log

  SCENARIO: Invalid login
    GIVEN a user with invalid credentials
    WHEN they submit the login form
    THEN they should see an error message
    AND remain on the login page

  SCENARIO: Role-based access control
    GIVEN a user with a specific role
    WHEN they access the application
    THEN they should only see rooms they have access to
    AND only have write permissions according to their role and current game phase
```

### 2. React Hooks Testing

```pseudocode
FEATURE: React Hooks
  FOR EACH hook (useWargame, useRooms, useRoom, useForce, usePlayer, useTemplates):
    SCENARIO: Hook initialization
      GIVEN the hook is mounted
      WHEN the component renders
      THEN it should initialize with default state
      AND subscribe to appropriate XMPP events/nodes

    SCENARIO: State updates
      GIVEN the hook is subscribed to XMPP events
      WHEN an event is received
      THEN the hook should update its state accordingly
      AND trigger re-renders with new data

    SCENARIO: Error handling
      GIVEN the hook encounters an error (network, parsing, etc.)
      WHEN the error occurs
      THEN it should handle the error gracefully
      AND provide appropriate error state to the component
```

### 3. UI Components

```pseudocode
FEATURE: UI Components
  FOR EACH component (RoomTab, MessageBubble, MessageInputForm, etc.):
    SCENARIO: Component rendering
      GIVEN the component receives valid props
      WHEN it renders
      THEN it should display correctly
      AND match the design specifications

    SCENARIO: Component interactions
      GIVEN a user interacts with the component
      WHEN they click/type/submit
      THEN the component should respond appropriately
      AND trigger the correct handlers/callbacks

    SCENARIO: Component states
      GIVEN the component has different states (loading, error, empty)
      WHEN those states occur
      THEN the component should render the appropriate UI for each state
```

### 4. Messaging

```pseudocode
FEATURE: Messaging
  SCENARIO: Plain text messaging
    GIVEN a user in a room with write permissions
    WHEN they send a plain text message
    THEN the message should be delivered to all room participants
    AND display with correct sender information and timestamp

  SCENARIO: Structured messaging
    GIVEN a user with an assigned template
    WHEN they fill and submit the template form
    THEN a structured message should be created
    AND delivered to all room participants
    AND rendered as a collapsible outline

  SCENARIO: Message permissions
    GIVEN a user in a room without write permissions for current phase
    WHEN they attempt to send a message
    THEN the UI should prevent message submission
    AND display appropriate feedback
```

### 5. Game State Management

```pseudocode
FEATURE: Game State
  SCENARIO: Game state synchronization
    GIVEN multiple connected clients
    WHEN Game Control advances the turn/phase
    THEN all clients should receive the updated state
    AND UI should update accordingly
    AND room permissions should adjust based on new phase

  SCENARIO: Game state persistence
    GIVEN a user refreshes their browser
    WHEN they reconnect
    THEN they should see the current game state
    AND have access to message history
```

### 6. Admin Functionality

```pseudocode
FEATURE: Admin Interface
  SCENARIO: Wargame setup
    GIVEN an admin user
    WHEN they configure a new wargame
    THEN the configuration should be saved to PubSub
    AND be accessible to all clients

  SCENARIO: Force and player management
    GIVEN an admin user
    WHEN they create forces and assign players
    THEN the appropriate XMPP users and groups should be created
    AND players should be able to login with assigned credentials

  SCENARIO: Room configuration
    GIVEN an admin user
    WHEN they create and configure rooms
    THEN MUC rooms should be created with correct permissions
    AND be visible to assigned players
```

## üß† Mocking Strategy

```pseudocode
STRATEGY: XMPP Mocking
  FOR unit and integration tests:
    MOCK XMPP client with controlled responses
    SIMULATE PubSub events and MUC messages
    VERIFY correct subscription and publishing behavior

  FOR E2E tests:
    USE test OpenFire instance with pre-configured state
    RESET between test runs
    VERIFY actual XMPP communication
```

## üîÑ Test Data Management

```pseudocode
STRATEGY: Test Data
  DEFINE fixture data for:
    - Users and credentials
    - Forces and roles
    - Room configurations
    - Message templates
    - Sample messages (plain and structured)
    - Game state scenarios

  ENSURE data covers:
    - Different roles (Player, Observer, Game Control)
    - Different phases and permissions
    - Edge cases and error conditions
```

## üì± Responsive Testing

```pseudocode
STRATEGY: Responsive Testing
  TEST on multiple viewport sizes:
    - Desktop (1920x1080, 1366x768)
    - Tablet (768x1024)
    - Mobile (375x667)

  VERIFY:
    - Layout adapts appropriately
    - Touch interactions work on mobile
    - FlexLayout behaves correctly on resize
```

## üöÄ Continuous Integration

```pseudocode
STRATEGY: CI Pipeline
  RUN unit and integration tests on every PR
  RUN E2E tests on merge to main
  GENERATE coverage reports
  FAIL build if coverage drops below thresholds:
    - Overall: 80%
    - Hooks: 90%
    - Components: 85%
    - Utilities: 90%
```

## üîç Special Testing Considerations

### Real-time Communication

```pseudocode
STRATEGY: Real-time Testing
  TEST message delivery latency
  VERIFY optimistic updates work correctly
  ENSURE proper handling of offline/reconnection scenarios
  VALIDATE typing indicators and read status tracking
```

### Security Testing

```pseudocode
STRATEGY: Security Testing
  VERIFY authentication mechanisms
  TEST role-based access controls
  ENSURE sensitive data (passwords) is handled securely
  VALIDATE input sanitization for message content
```

## üìà Test Metrics and Reporting

```pseudocode
STRATEGY: Metrics
  TRACK:
    - Test coverage percentage
    - Number of passing/failing tests
    - Test execution time
    - Flaky tests

  REPORT:
    - Generate HTML coverage reports
    - Integrate with CI dashboard
    - Alert on coverage regression
```

## üóìÔ∏è Testing Roadmap

1. Set up testing infrastructure and CI pipeline
2. Implement core hook unit tests
3. Implement component unit tests
4. Develop integration tests for key features
5. Create E2E tests for critical user flows
6. Implement performance and security tests
7. Establish continuous monitoring and regression testing
