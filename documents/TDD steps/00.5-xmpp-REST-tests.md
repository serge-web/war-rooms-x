# 1. XMPP REST tests

The REST API for openfire is documented here: https://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/plugins/1.3.8/restAPI/readme.html

## 1.1 XMPP REST Connection

As a Senior Typescript Developer, specializing in XMPP and TypeScript, it is your goal to write unit tests for XMPP messaging in the War-Rooms-X application. We need to produce tests to verify that the OpenFire server follows XMPP protocols, as implemented in the Stanza.js library. You will write the test first, then execute 'yarn test' and continue to fix errors until the test passes. You will follow SOLID and DRY coding principles, one class per file, no God classes.

Focus on testing that we are able to:
- login to the REST interface for the server using credentials in openfire.json

## 1.2 Get Groups / Forces

As a Senior Typescript Developer, specializing in XMPP and TypeScript, it is your goal to write unit tests for XMPP messaging in the War-Rooms-X application. We need to produce tests to verify that the OpenFire server follows XMPP protocols, as implemented in the Stanza.js library. You will write the test first, then execute 'yarn test' and continue to fix errors until the test passes. You will follow SOLID and DRY coding principles, one class per file, no God classes.

Focus on testing that we are able to:
- get a list of groups from the server (we use these for the Forces in this app)

## 1.3 Get Users

As a Senior Typescript Developer, specializing in XMPP and TypeScript, it is your goal to write unit tests for XMPP messaging in the War-Rooms-X application. We need to produce tests to verify that the OpenFire server follows XMPP protocols, as implemented in the Stanza.js library. You will write the test first, then execute 'yarn test' and continue to fix errors until the test passes. You will follow SOLID and DRY coding principles, one class per file, no God classes.

Focus on testing that we are able to:
- get a list of users from the server (we use these for the Players in this app)

## 1.4 Get Rooms / Channels

As a Senior Typescript Developer, specializing in XMPP and TypeScript, it is your goal to write unit tests for XMPP messaging in the War-Rooms-X application. We need to produce tests to verify that the OpenFire server follows XMPP protocols, as implemented in the Stanza.js library. You will write the test first, then execute 'yarn test' and continue to fix errors until the test passes. You will follow SOLID and DRY coding principles, one class per file, no God classes.

Focus on testing that we are able to:
- get a list of rooms from the server (channels in this app)

## 1.5 Add new user

As a Senior Typescript Developer, specializing in XMPP and TypeScript, it is your goal to write unit tests for XMPP messaging in the War-Rooms-X application. We need to produce tests to verify that the OpenFire server follows XMPP protocols, as implemented in the Stanza.js library. You will write the test first, then execute 'yarn test' and continue to fix errors until the test passes. You will follow SOLID and DRY coding principles, one class per file, no God classes.

Focus on testing that we are able to:
- add a new user to the server
- delete that user from the server

## 1.6 Set and retrieve cVard

As a Senior Typescript Developer, specializing in XMPP and TypeScript, it is your goal to write unit tests for XMPP messaging in the War-Rooms-X application. We need to produce tests to verify that the OpenFire server follows XMPP protocols, as implemented in the Stanza.js library. You will write the test first, then execute 'yarn test' and continue to fix errors until the test passes. You will follow SOLID and DRY coding principles, one class per file, no God classes.

Focus on testing that we are able to:
- set the vCard for the admin user
- set the vCard for the no-perms user
- get the vCard for the no-perms user
