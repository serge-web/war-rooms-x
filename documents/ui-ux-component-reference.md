üì± General Layout Components

1. Room Tabs
	‚Ä¢	Description: Displays each room as a clickable tab at the top of the room panel.
	‚Ä¢	Behavior:
	‚Ä¢	Click to open the corresponding room.
	‚Ä¢	Display an ‚Äúinfo‚Äù icon (i) on rooms with available metadata.
	‚Ä¢	Show an active state when selected.
	‚Ä¢	Props:
	‚Ä¢	roomName: The name of the room.
	‚Ä¢	isActive: Boolean to indicate if this tab is currently active.
	‚Ä¢	onClick: Function to trigger when the tab is clicked.

Example:
```jsx
<RoomTab
  roomName="blue_chat"
  isActive={true}
  onClick={() => handleRoomClick("blue_chat")}
/>
```

2. Message Bubble
	‚Ä¢	Description: Displays each message within a room, showing the sender, timestamp, and content.
	‚Ä¢	Behavior:
	‚Ä¢	Differentiate between plain text and structured messages.
	‚Ä¢	Render structured messages as an outline list.
	‚Ä¢	Show the sender‚Äôs role and force next to their name.
	‚Ä¢	Apply styling based on message type (e.g., colors for different forces).
	‚Ä¢	Props:
	‚Ä¢	message: The full message object (including sender, timestamp, content, type).
	‚Ä¢	isSender: Boolean to indicate if the current user sent the message.
	‚Ä¢	messageType: Type of message (plain, structured).
	‚Ä¢	roleColor: Color for the sender‚Äôs role (e.g., Blue, Red).

Example:
```jsx
<MessageBubble 
  message={message} 
  isSender={true} 
  messageType="structured" 
  roleColor="#1e3a8a"
/>
```

üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë User Interaction Components

3. Message Input Form
	‚Ä¢	Description: A form to submit messages within a room. The form is dynamically configured based on whether the message is plain or structured.
	‚Ä¢	Behavior:
	‚Ä¢	The form should render the appropriate input field (text input for plain chat or dynamic form for structured messages).
	‚Ä¢	When a message is submitted, the handleMessageSubmit function (retrieved via useRoom) will handle sending the message.
	‚Ä¢	The room context (e.g., active room) is also automatically retrieved from the useRoom hook, so it‚Äôs unnecessary to pass the room and the submit handler as props.
	‚Ä¢	Props:
	‚Ä¢	None (the useRoom hook will internally handle room and submit logic)
	‚Ä¢	Example:
```jsx
function MessageInputForm() {
  const { room, handleMessageSubmit } = useRoom(); // Automatically retrieve room context
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  const onSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    handleMessageSubmit(message);
    setMessage(''); // Reset input after submission
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={onSubmit} className="message-input-form">
      <input
        type="text"
        value={message}
        onChange={(e) => setMessage(e.target.value)}
        placeholder={`Type a message in ${room}`}
        className="message-input"
      />
      <button type="submit" className="send-button">Send</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

4. Template Form
	‚Ä¢	Description: Displays the structured form for sending template-based messages.
	‚Ä¢	Behavior:
	‚Ä¢	Uses RJSF (React JSON Schema Form) to dynamically render a form based on the template schema.
	‚Ä¢	Allows players to fill out the form and submit the structured message.
	‚Ä¢	If a template is not assigned, fall back to the plain message form.
	‚Ä¢	Props:
	‚Ä¢	template: JSON schema of the selected template.
	‚Ä¢	onSubmit: Function to handle submission of the structured message.
	‚Ä¢	phase: Current game phase to enforce template availability.

Example:
```jsx
<TemplateForm 
  template={selectedTemplate} 
  onSubmit={handleTemplateSubmit} 
  phase="Planning" 
/>
```

5. Button
	‚Ä¢	Description: A reusable button component with support for different styles (primary, secondary, etc.).
	‚Ä¢	Behavior:
	‚Ä¢	Triggers a custom onClick function.
	‚Ä¢	Can be styled differently based on the type of action (e.g., submit, cancel).
	‚Ä¢	Props:
	‚Ä¢	label: Button text.
	‚Ä¢	onClick: Function triggered on button click.
	‚Ä¢	type: Button type (primary, secondary, danger).

  type="primary" 
  disabled={isDisabled}

```

6. Modal
	‚Ä¢	Description: A modal window that can display various types of content (e.g., message history, system logs).
	‚Ä¢	Behavior:
	‚Ä¢	Opened when triggered by a specific action (e.g., ‚ÄúView System Log‚Äù).
	‚Ä¢	Can be closed by clicking the ‚ÄúClose‚Äù button or clicking outside the modal.
	‚Ä¢	Props:
	‚Ä¢	isOpen: Boolean to control the modal‚Äôs visibility.
	‚Ä¢	content: The content to be rendered inside the modal.
	‚Ä¢	onClose: Function to handle modal close action.

Example:
```jsx

  isOpen={isModalOpen} 
  content={logContent} 
  onClose={closeModal} 
/>
```

7. Player Banner
	‚Ä¢	Description: A small banner that displays the current player‚Äôs identity (name, role, force, and icon).
	‚Ä¢	Behavior:
